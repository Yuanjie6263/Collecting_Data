This is a README file for this repository. The dataset of thie repository is derived from https://osf.io/zyaqn/files/osfstorage.

1. Specify a topic on which you'd like to work in the following weeks (don't worry, you can change it later on)
   Crime in USA
   
2. Provide some context for the topic, citing existing research (theoretical, interpretative, and/or empirical) that makes some testable claims
   In their article "Crime Rate Inference with Big Data", Wang and his/her colleagues use large-scale Point-Of-Interest data and taxi flow data to predict crime. Meng, Yunliang also found in the article "Crime rates and contextual characteristics: a case study in Connecticut,USA" the association between crime rates and the explanatory variables significantlyã€‚
   
3. formulate at least one research question (RQ) and/or hypothesis
   Whether there are differences in the main categories of crime in different regions
   
4. explaining how you think you can explore the proposed topic and address the RQs
   Firstly, the data from three different cities in the United States, namely Kansas City, Los Angeles and New York in the first quarter of 2021, were analysed to calculate the average crime rate based on population; secondly, to see if there were differences in the main crime categories; and finally, to see if the specific crime categories differed and to try to analyse the reasons for this, or an in-depth analysis of a particular category of crime.
   
5. describe what kind of data you need to answer your RQs and/or test your hypothesis
   the data of the crime cases in these threee cities, the population, and other possible data, for instance, e.g. traffice volume in an area, use of the area, etc..
